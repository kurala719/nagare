# Nagare Frontend: The Beautiful & Fast Interface

If the Backend is the "Brain," the Frontend is the **"Face and Body"** of Nagare. It's what you see, touch, and interact with every day. We built it to be as easy to use as a smartphone app, even though it's doing very complex work.

## 1. Built with Vue 3
We use a technology called **Vue 3**. It's like having a set of high-tech building blocks. It makes the website very "reactive"—if a server crashes, the dashboard turns red **instantly** without you having to refresh the page.

## 2. "Speed You Can Feel" (The User Experience)
A website that feels slow is frustrating. We used several tricks to make Nagare feel "snappy":
- **Skeleton Screens**: Before the data arrives from the server, we show a gray "skeleton" of the page. This tells your brain "the page is loading" so it feels faster than just seeing a white screen.
- **Smart Loading**: Instead of loading the entire app at once, Nagare only loads the part you are looking at right now. This is like only turning on the lights in the room you are currently in.
- **Icon Language**: We use clear icons (from "Element Plus") so you don't have to read a wall of text to understand what's happening. A red bell 🔔 means danger; a green check ✅ means everything is perfect.

## 3. Beautiful Charts
We use **ECharts** (the world's most powerful charting library). This turns thousands of boring numbers into:
- **Glowing Heatmaps**: See which parts of your system are getting "hot" (busy).
- **Interactive Graphs**: You can zoom in on a specific hour to see exactly when a problem started.

## 4. One Dashboard, Many Languages
Nagare supports **Internationalization (i18n)**. Whether you speak English, Chinese, or Japanese, Nagare can speak your language. You can switch with one click.

## 5. Security for your Browser
- **Sanitization**: Every time Nagare shows you a message, it "scrubs" it clean to make sure no malicious code (like "XSS") can sneak in and steal your information.
- **Automatic Logout**: If you leave your computer for too long, Nagare automatically locks the door to keep your data safe.

## 6. Summary
The Nagare interface is designed to be **"Human-First."** It hides the complex math and code under a hood of beautiful colors, fast buttons, and clear messages.
