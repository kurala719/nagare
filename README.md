# Nagare - Unified Monorepo

Welcome to the **Nagare** project! This is a comprehensive monitoring and automation system featuring a modern web UI and a robust Go-based backend.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is organized as a monorepo containing both the frontend and backend codebases:

- **`frontend/`**: The web user interface built with **Vue 3** and **Vite**.
- **`backend/`**: The API server and core logic built with **Go (Golang)** and **Gin**.
- **`doc/`**: Project documentation, guides, and architectural references.
- **`tests/`**: Integration tests and utility scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.21 or higher (for backend).
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (for frontend).
- **Database**: A compatible SQL database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) supported by GORM.
- **Redis**: (Optional) For task queue management.

### Quick Start
